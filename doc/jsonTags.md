# jsonTags.md

The intent of this file is to provide syntax guidelines to developers for
marking up json entries. While some of these tags are usable in most of the
`*.json`files in the `data` directory, some tags are file specific and will be
noted here.

## Adventures

These are tags used in the various `*.json` files in the `data/adventures`
directory.

Desired Output | Tag
-------------- | ------
Italics | {@i This text is italicized.}
Bold | {@b This text is bolded.}
